# CawCawCaw

> Note: When the cat goes cawcawcaw!!!

## Motive:
Automatic translation of videos :)

> Note: If you would ask why I need this, my answer would be to watch my favorite `anime`.


## Steps:
1. Separate `audio` and `video` of the media file.

2. Translate audio into whichever language you need (will mostly be used for Japanese to English translation).

3. Merge the `translated audio` and `video` into new media file. **DONE!**


## Requirements:
* Java8+
* Gradle
* Eclipse with builship gradle plugin and Project Lombok
* [Humble video library](https://github.com/artclarke/humble-video) and [ffmpeg library](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
* A great language transalation service that can do speech to text or speech to speech. (Any suggestions?)


### Big Note:
Suggestions are always welcome.
